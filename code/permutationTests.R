## keep predictor variable values fixed, shuffle response
## recompute beta coefficients
## repeat to get distribution of each beta coefficient
## grab quantiles to get confidence intervals

## Question: what is the most "fair" way to shuffle?
## 1.) all responses are up for grabs
## 2.) fix the time frame, resample across locations at the same time step
## 3.) fix the location, resample across time in the same county

## Each approach answers a differently focused question.
## 1.) Is the spatio-temporal structure statistically significant?
## 2.) Is the spatial structure statistically significant?
## 3.) Is the temporal structure statistically significant?
