# Analysis Stage 1 Readme

## Description

This readme describes the contents of code/analysis_stage1. 

## Files

- runningAllModels.R: runs all combinations of predictor and response variables for the stage 1 model

## Outputs

- csv files in results/coefficients_stage1: r(#1)p(#2) means the response variable is column #1 in "data/data_combined.csv" combined and the predictor variable is column #2 in "data/data_combined.csv"

## Model

**In words:**

social outcome$_{county, year}$ ~ drought measure$_{county, year}$+ county level variability+ county=year variability +state=year variability

Social Outcomes:

  - mortality (>65, all)
  
  - crop yields (corn, wheat, soybeans)
  
  - unemployment rate
  
Drought Measures: number of weeks in severe, extreme, and/or exceptional drought levels

  - 1 year lag
  
  - 3 year lag
  
  - 5 year lag

**Equation:**

$$ y_{i,t} \beta_iD_{i,t}+\alpha_i+\tau_it +\gamma_{s,t}+\epsilon_{i,t}$$

Where:

  - $D_{i,t}$ refers to the number of weeks in U.S. Drought Survey bins 2-4 in county $i$ and year $t$
  
  - $\alpha_i$ are county fixed effects controlling for time-invariant differences between counties
  
  - $\tau_i$ is the coefficient on a county level linear time trend
  
  - $\gamma_{s,t}$ are state-by-year fixed effects controlling for state level time trends common across all counties $i \in s$

**First Stage $\rightarrow$ Second Stage**

The $\beta$ coefficients are the response variable in the second stage regression. The (clustered) standard errors are used in a weighted regression approach.
