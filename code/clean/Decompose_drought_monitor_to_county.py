# Title: Decompose drought monitor data to counties

# Description: This script takes weekly US Drought Monitor polygons (http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/MapsAndData/GISData.aspx), decompose them to US counties. The US Drought Monitor polygons are not included in the repository due to the file size.

# Attention: do not run this script as it take time. This script require arcpy in python 2 to process to run the script

# Input: US Drought Monitor polygons from US Drought Monitor starting from 2000 (http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/MapsAndData/GISData.aspx).
# Unzip the zipfiles, put the shapefiles from all the years directly in directory ("../data/drought_monitor/original_drought_monitor_data"). Do not use subfolders for each year.

# Output: csv tables for each county's area under different levels of drought, weekly
