# Analysis Stage 2 Readme

## Description

This readme describes the contents of code/analysis_stage2. 

## Files
- merge_betas_predictors.R	
- merge_stage1_betas.R
- regressions.R

These R code files merge the beta values from the Analysis Stage 1 together with summary statistics (mean and standard deviation) of county-level characteristics including the American Community Survey data. 

The regressions code file regresses each Analysis Stage 1 beta value (the coefficients from regression outcomes such as unemployment or mortality on drought indicators) on the county-level characteristics. 

## Folders
- combined_inputs			


This folder contains the output from the merge files, which are used as input in the regressions code. 

Columns represent interaction coefficients for OLS regressions of a predcitor on a response variable. The predictor variables are coded as pxx and the responses are coded as rxx where the number xx refers to column xx in data/combined_data.csv. 

For example, r11p14 refers to the coefficient of a regression of column 14 on column 11.
