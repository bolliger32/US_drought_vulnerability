Raw Data: This folder contains the raw data from NOAA.  All variables are at the monthly / climatological division level.

Source:  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/cirs/climdiv/

Acquisition Method: download_noaa.R 

File format: unique identifier in the format: StateCode|Division|ElementCode|Year
													 XX XX XX XXXX

	Each file contains observations of a single monthly variable for every division in every state in the years 1895-2016.
	Accordingly, there is one file each for precipitation, average temp, several drought indices, Cooling Degree Days, and Heating Degree Days.

	For detailed information on each variable and methodology, please see noaa_official_README.txt.


Cleaning

Method: clean_noaa_data.R
Output: noaa_cleaned.csv
	This .csv contains the following columns:

		Division  State  Year  Precip Temp PDSI PHDI ZNDX HDD CDD


The divisions still need to be matched to the GISJOIN variable we will use to merge all our data.

Process:

A. In each data set:
	1. Years 1895-1999 were dropped
	2. The unique identifier was disaggregated into state, division, element, and year variables
	3. The element code variable was dropped and instead the vars of interest were renamed, ie, instead
		of having element code  06 and variables V1, V2, V3..., element code was dropped and the
		variables were renamed prcp01, prcp02, prcp03...
	- Variable naming convention: 2-digit suffix gives month of the year
		
B. All NOAA datasets were merged on state, division, and year
