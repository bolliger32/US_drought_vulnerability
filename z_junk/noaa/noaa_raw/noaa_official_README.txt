                                   JUNE 2014

The major parameters in this file are sequential climatic division monthly 
maximum, minimum and average temperature (deg. F. to 10ths, national 
temperature to 100ths), precipitation (inches to 100ths), Standardized 
Precipitation Index (SPI), and Palmer Drought Indices (PDSI, PHDI, PMDI, 
and ZNDX). Period of record is 1895 through latest month available, updated 
monthly.

Values from the most recent two calendar years will be updated on a monthly 
basis.  Period of record updates will occur when the underlying data set 
undergoes a version change.

METHODOLOGY:

Divisional values in nClimDiv were derived from area-weighted averages of 
grid-point estimates interpolated from station data.  A nominal grid resolution
of 5 km was used to ensure that all divisions had sufficient spatial sampling 
(only four small divisions had less than 100 points) and because the impact of 
elevation on precipitation is minimal below 5 km.  Station data were gridded 
via climatologically aided interpolation to minimize biases from topographic 
and network variability.

The Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN)  Daily dataset is the source 
of station data for nClimDiv.  GHCN-Daily contains several major observing 
networks in North America, five of which are used here.  The primary network 
is the National Weather Service (NWS) Cooperative Observing (COOP) program, 
which consists of stations operated by volunteers as well as by agencies such 
as the Federal Aviation Administration.  To improve coverage in western states 
and along international borders, nClimDiv also includes the National 
Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) Remote Automatic Weather Station (RAWS) network, 
the USDA Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) network, the Environment Canada (EC) 
network (south of 52°N), and part of Mexicos Servicio Meteorologico Nacional 
(SMN) network (north of 24°N).  Note that nClimDiv does not incorporate 
precipitation data from RAWS because that networks tipping-bucket gauges are 
unheated, leading to suspect cold-weather data.

All GHCN-Daily stations are routinely processed through a suite of logical, 
serial, and spatial quality assurance reviews to identify erroneous 
observations.  For nClimDiv, all such data were set to missing before 
computing monthly values, which in turn were subjected to additional serial 
and spatial checks to eliminate residual outliers. Stations having at least 
10 years of valid monthly data since 1950 were used in nClimDiv.

For temperature, bias adjustments were computed to account for historical 
changes in observation time, station location, temperature instrumentation, 
and siting conditions.  Changes in observation time are only problematic for 
the COOP network whereas changes in station location and instrumentation occur 
in almost all surface networks.   As in the U.S. Historical Climatology Network
version 2.5, the method of Karl et al. (1986) was applied to remove the 
observation time bias from the COOP network, and the pairwise method of Menne 
and Williams (2009) was used to address changes in station location and 
instrumentation in all networks.  Because the pairwise method also largely 
accounts for local, unrepresentative trends that arise from changes in siting 
conditions, nClimDiv contains no separate adjustment in that regard.

Monthly heating and cooling degree day values are available for the period
1895 to present.  The divisional degree day values are derived from  the
adjusted temperatures using a statistical algorithm.  The heating and cooling
degree day values available at this site are used for operational monitoring
purposes and may be different from the heating and cooling degree day values
published in official degree day publications.  Population weights utilize 
the 1981-2010 Census data.

Historical drought data have been added to this file for the period 1895 to
present.  The file is updated monthly.  All drought data are calibrated using 
the period 1931-1990 (cf. Karl, 1986; Journal of Climate and Applied 
Meteorology, Vol. 25, No. 1, January 1986).  Drought data include: 

1.  Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI)

 This is the monthly value (index) that is generated indicating the severity
 of a wet or dry spell.  This index is based on the principles of a balance
 between moisture supply and demand.  Man-made changes were not considered in
 this calculation.  The index generally ranges from -6 to +6, with negative
 values denoting dry spells and positive values indicating wet spells.  There
 are a few values in the magnitude of +7 or -7.  PDSI values 0 to -.5 =
 normal; -0.5 to -1.0 = incipient drought; -1.0 to -2.0 = mild drought; -2.0
 to -3.0 = moderate drought; -3.0 to -4.0 = severe drought; and greater than -
 4.0 = extreme drought.  Similar adjectives are attached to positive values of
 wet spells.  This is a meteorological drought index used to assess the
 severity of dry or wet spells of weather.

2.  Palmer Hydrological Drought Index (PHDI)

 This is the monthly value (index) generated monthly that indicates the
 severity of a wet or dry spell.  This index is based on the principles of a
 balance between moisture supply and demand.  Man-made changes such as
 increased irrigation, new reservoirs, and added industrial water use were not
 included in the computation of this index.  The index generally ranges from -
 6 to +6, with negative values denoting dry spells, and positive values
 indicating wet spells.  There are a few values in the magnitude of +7 or -7. 
 PHDI values 0 to -0.5 = normal; -0.5 to -1.0 = incipient drought; -1.0 to -
 2.0 = mild drought; -2.0 to -3.0 = moderate drought; -3.0 to -4.0 = severe
 drought; and greater than -4.0 = extreme drought.  Similar adjectives are
 attached to positive values of wet spells.  This is a hydrological drought
 index used to assess long-term moisture supply.

3.  Palmer "Z" Index (ZNDX)

 This is the generated monthly Z values, and they can be expressed as the
 "Moisture Anomaly Index."  Each monthly Z value is a measure of the departure
 from normal of the moisture climate for that month.  This index can respond
 to a month of above-normal precipitation, even during periods of drought. 
 Table 1 contains expected values of the Z index and other drought parameters. 
 See Historical Climatology Series 3-6 through 3-9 for a detailed description
 of the drought indices.

4.  Modified Palmer Drought Severity Index (PMDI)

 This is a modification of the Palmer Drought Severity Index.  The
 modification was made by the National Weather Service Climate Analysis Center
 for operational meteorological purposes.  The Palmer drought program
 calculates three intermediate parallel index values each month.  Only one
 value is selected as the PDSI drought index for the month.  This selection is
 made internally by the program on the basis of probabilities.  If the
 probability that a drought is over is 100%, then one index is used.  If the
 probability that a wet spell is over is 100%, then another index is used.  If
 the probability is between 0% and 100%, the third index is assigned to the
 PDSI.  The modification (PMDI) incorporates a weighted average of the wet and
 dry index terms, using the probability as the weighting factor.  (Thomas R.
 Heddinghause and Paul Sabol, 1991; "A Review of the Palmer Drought Severity
 Index and Where Do We Go From Here?," Proceedings of the Seventh Conference
 on Applied Climatology, pp. 242-246, American Meteorological Society, Boston,
 MA).  The PMDI and PDSI will have the same value during an established
 drought or wet spell (i.e., when the probability is 100%), but they will have
 different values during transition periods.

5.  Standardized Precipitation Index (SPxx)

This is a transformation of the probability of observing a given amount of 
precipitation in xx months.  A zero index value reflects the median of the 
distribution of precipitation, a -3 indicates a very extreme dry spell, and a 
+3 indicates a very extreme wet spell.  The more the index value departs from 
zero, the drier or wetter an event lasting xx months is when compared to the 
long-term climatology of the location.  The index allows for comparison of 
precipitation observations at different locations with markedly different 
climates; an index value at one location expresses the same relative departure 
from median conditions at one location as at another location.  It is 
calculated for different time scales since it is possible to experience dry 
conditions over one time scale while simultaneously experiencing wet conditions 
over a different time scale.
