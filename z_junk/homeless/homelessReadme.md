#Homeless Data Information

##Data Availability

- HUD provides an ArcGIS geodatabase of all CoCs for 2014 and 2013. We could use this or possibly convert it to a format useable in R or another program.
- I don’t currently have access to ArcGIS (since I don’t have Microsoft Windows), and so am combining the individual shapefiles instead of using the geodatabase.

##2 Options for Analyzing Homeless Data:

###1. Use Smaller Amount, but More Complete Data (this is what Dan is currently working on)
    -  Prepare Homeless Data
        - Download all CoCs from one base year (i.e. 2014)
        - Combine all shapefiles into a U.S. CoC shapefile  
        - Add homeless population data to each CoC in the shapefile for each year
        - Note: This omits data for CoCs that did not exist in the base year

    - Prepare Drought Data
        - Aggregate drought/create a drought index at the base-year CoC geographic level for each year

    - Analysis

###2.  Use Larger Amount, but Less Complete Data
    - Prepare Homeless Data
        - Download all CoCs, organizing them into directories by year (i.e. all 2014 CoC shapefile folders go in a 2014 folder) 
        - Combine all shapefiles for each year into a U.S. CoC shapefile for that year
        - Add homeless population data for each CoC to the corresponding CoCs in the shapefile for each year 
        - Note: This uses all the available CoC data, but creates some problems for analysis (i.e. CoCs with NaNs).

    - Prepare Drought Data
        - Aggregate drought/create a drought index at the CoC geographic level for each year

    - Analysis
        - If there are CoC’s that existing 1 year and not another, then we have a missing data issue




##To Do

##Combine CoC Shapefiles and Assign 2014 Homeless Pop Value to ARD Column
# This should be updated to create a new column, perhaps using package Rgdal and
# SpatialDataFrameName@data[[“colname”]] = col data where col data is a 1 column matrix
# with the same number as rows as SpatialDataFrameName@data
