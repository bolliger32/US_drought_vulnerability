    Brief Description:
    
    * NCEP's high resolution combined model and assimilated dataset. It
    covers 1979 to near present and is provided 8-times daily, daily
    and monthly on a Northern Hemisphere Lambert Conformal Conic grid
    for all variables. More...
    
    Temporal Coverage:
    
    * 8-times, Daily and Monthly means for 1979/01/01 to Dec 31, 2014 .
    * Long Term Daily, Monthly means for years 1979 - 2000.
    
    Spatial Coverage:
    
    * The native model grid is converted to a Northern Lambert Conformal
    Conic grid which is what we archive. Corners of this grid are
    
    1.000001N, 145.5W; 0.897945N, 68.32005W; 46.3544N, 2.569891W;
    46.63433N, 148.6418E
    The grid resolution is 349x277 which is approximately 0.3 degrees
    (32km) resolution at the lowest latitude. A page describing the
    coverage along with information on reading the projection is
    available.

    and cloud heights, and entire atmosphere.

    * None
    
    Detailed Description:
    
    * The NARR project is an extension of the NCEP Global Reanalysis
    which is run over the North American Region. The NARR model uses
    the very high resolution NCEP Eta Model (32km/45 layer) together
    with the Regional Data Assimilation System (RDAS) which,
    significantly, assimilates precipitation along with other
    variables. The improvements in the model/assimilation have resulted
    in a dataset with substantial improvements in the accuracy of
    temperature, winds and precipitation compared to the NCEP-DOE
    Global Reanalysis 2. We currently have output which includes 8
    times daily data at 29 levels and most of the variables. For a
    complete list of model output variables, see NCEP's variable list.
    * Additional information can be found at NCEP's NARR page.
    
    Caveats:
    
    * Useful information can be found at NCEP's NARR FAQ page and from
    Albany's Department of Atmospheric Science NARR Usage Notes.
    
    Related File Naming & Structure Information:
    
    File Names:
    * 8-times daily and daily File names are composed of variable
    abbreviations and year/month or just year : as yyyymm.nc or
    yyyy.nc(In directory: /Datasets/NARR/ or /Datasets/NARR/Dailies/)
    * Monthly means/ltms are (variable).mon.mean.nc in
    /Datasets/NARR/Monthlies/
    
    Dataset Format and Size:
    * All data are stored in PSD standard NetCDF3 files and are (packed).
    * The data are divided by variable and year and month into separate
    files
    * There are 2100 files currently
    * Size of file is about 1.4G per variable per year/month for 8xdaily
    data
    * Size of file is about 68M per variable per /month for monthly data
    * Current total of 29.4 Tbytes for 8xDaily.
    
    * 8x daily data are available from ftp.cdc.noaa.gov in
    /Datasets/NARR/.
    * The 8x data files are quite large, so you may only be able to
    download them if you have a fast network connection.
    
    Missing Data:
    * Missing data is flagged with a value of 32767s.
    
    Citation:
    
    * Please note: If you acquire NCEP Reanalysis data products from PSD,
    we ask that you acknowledge us in your use of the data. This may be
    done by including text such as NCEP Reanalysis data provided by the
    NOAA/OAR/ESRL PSD, Boulder, Colorado, USA, from their Web site at
    http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/ in any documents or publications
    using these data. We would also appreciate receiving a copy of the
    relevant publications. This will help PSD to justify keeping the
    NCEP Reanalysis data set freely available online in the future.
    Thank you!
