# EPA Data Readme

## Description

This readme described how the EPA data were obtained and cleaned. For information on the variables, data collection, and methodology, please see the official EPA readme also located in this folder.

## Source

These data were downloaded manually and then cleaned with the clean_epa.R code before committing to git because the full file is too large for the repo.  The code extracts the relevant variables and creates a .csv.

## To download the data, 
1. Go to `https://www.epa.gov/enviro/geospatial-data-download-service' and click "single"
2. Unzip the file
3. Run the clean_epa.R code

These three steps will create the clean_epa.csv and save it to your data/epa folder.
