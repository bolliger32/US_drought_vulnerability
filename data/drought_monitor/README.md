# Drought Monitor Data Readme

aggregate US drought monitor data to county

sample_decomposed_DM_USDM_20000104.csv shows a example of how DM data in 2000-01-04 is decomposed by counties. The area under each DM level for each county is stored in field: POLY_AREA. Use the DM_mod for the DM level. DM_mod = DM+1, to distinguish DM = 0 from unimpacted areas (which is 0 by default).
