# Drought Monitor Data Readme
## Description
This folder contains the inputs and instructions to calcualte the drought indicator for the analysis stage. It takes the weekly drought shapefiles from the [US drought monitor] (http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/MapsAndData/GISData.aspx) from 2000 to present, decomposes the shapefiles by counties, and calculates the drought index for the counties.

aggregate US drought monitor data to county

sample_decomposed_DM_USDM_20000104.csv shows a example of how DM data in 2000-01-04 is decomposed by counties. The area under each DM level for each county is stored in field: POLY_AREA. Use the DM_mod for the DM level. DM_mod = DM+1, to distinguish DM = 0 from unimpacted areas (which is 0 by default).

## Source

The data is from US drought monitor, 

## To download the data
1. Go to http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/MapsAndData/GISData.aspx
2. Go through each year from 2000 to present using the left pannel.
3. In each year, use the top-left "Download all Drought Monitor shapefiles for year XXXX" to download the weekly Drought Monitor shapefiles for the year in zip files.
4. Unzip the zipfiles, put the shapefiles from all the years directly in directory ("../data/drought_monitor/original_drought_monitor_data"). **Do not use subfolders for each year**.

## To get the drought index used in the analysis stage
1. Run "../code/clean/Decompose_drought_monitor_to_county.py". This script calculates the area under each DM level in each county, each week, as save the results as a csv in folder "../data/drought_monitor/processed_drought_monitor_data/csv/". **Do not run this code unless necessary, as it takes a long time to process**.
2. Run "../code/clean/summarize_decomposed_weekly_DM.ipynb" to summarize the weekly csv from the step above. For each DM level, it generates a csv that shows the area in each county that is under the DM level in each week. **Don not run this code as the output from step 1 is not pushed to the repository due to file size**.
3. Run "../code/calculate_drought_indicator_from_domposed_DM.ipynb" to use the output from the setp above and calculat the drought indicator.
