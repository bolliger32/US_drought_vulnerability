# Yield Data Readme

## Description

This readme described how the yield data were obtained and cleaned.

These data were used to obtain a measure of county-by-year yields from the late 90's through 2014 for the following three crops: corn, soy, and wheat. Yields are reported in the units of bushels/acre for each crop.

## Source

These data were downloaded manually via an API - the only way we found to access the data. Then, the data were cleaned with the `compile_NASS_yield.do` code before committing to git.  The code extracts the relevant variables and creates `NASS_all.csv`, which is included in this folder.

## To download the data:
1. Go to https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/
2. Under `Program:` click "Survey"
3. Under `Commodity:` select one of "corn," "soy," or "wheat"
4. Under `Geographic Level:` select "County"
5. Under `Time:` select the year(s) of interest.
6. Note that a maximum of 50,000 records can be accessed at one time. Reduce the number of years selected in order to reduce the number of records, if needed.
7. Click "Get Records"
8. Once the data loads in a new screen, click "Spreadsheet" in the upper right corner.
9. Save the file as `[crop]_[startYear]_[endYear].csv,` in the `US_drought_vulnerability/tree/master/data/yield/raw` directory.  For example corn data from 2002 - 2004 would be saved as `corn_2002_2004.csv`
10. Repeat until data for all crops and all years have been downloaded.
