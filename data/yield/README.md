# EPA Data Readme

## Description

This readme described how the EPA data were obtained and cleaned. For information on the variables, data collection, and methodology, please see the official EPA readme also located in this folder.

These data are used to create a measure of the water intensiveness of the local economy.  The EPA collects data on all of the facilities it regulates in the United States.  We extract the FIPS code and the industrial category (SIC code) for each facility.  Then we create a dummy variable for high water use and count the number of high-use facilities per county.

The SICs that are coded high water- use are:

    - Water-intensive industries:
    - 0100-0999 Agriculture, forestry, fishing
    - 2000-3999 Manufacturing
    - 4900-4932 Energy

## Source

These data were downloaded manually and then cleaned with the clean_epa.R code before committing to git because the full file is too large for the repo.  The code extracts the relevant variables and creates `clean_epa.csv`, which is included in this folder.

## To download the data, 
1. Go to `https://www.epa.gov/enviro/geospatial-data-download-service' and click "single"
2. Unzip the file
3. Run the clean_epa.R code

These three steps will create the clean_epa.csv and save it to your data/epa folder.

## Caveats

There are several important issues with the use and interpretation of these data.  We would like to clearly describe them up front.  We decided to use the data despite these issues because it provided another opportunity to practice data management skills and because they may still provide some, albeit limited, insight.

1. Dates of coverage: These data are for facilities managed as of March, 2016.  There is no way to gauge how the distribution of water-intensive industry has changed over time.  This leads to two sample bias problems: first, the facilities contained in this data may not have existed during the window of our study.  Second and most importantly for our purposes, there may be an endogeneity problem where high water-use facilities in high-drought areas have shut down over the window of analysis and are missing from this sample.  This will bias our estimates of the importance of water intensity down.

2.  Missing values:  About 2/3 of the observations are missing either a FIPS or a SIC code, and so were dropped.  If this censoring is nonrandom, it introduces an additional source of bias to the study.
