# Mortality Data Information

## Raw Data

### Source

Under-5, over-65, and all-ages mortality was downloaded from the [CDC WONDER](http://wonder.cdc.gov) [compressed mortality database for 1999-2014](http://wonder.cdc.gov/cmf-icd10.html) for both genders combined on Mar 17, 2016.

### Acquisition Method
The CDC WONDER API [only works for national data requests](http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/WONDER-API.html#More), so could not be used for data acquisition for this project. Instead, we used the [web application provided by the CDC](http://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D124). Datasets were downloaded by age-group, sex, year. For clarity, the following settings were chosen on the web app (options for which we used default values are not included):
- Organize table layout
    - Group Results By: County
    - Meaures: Default values + "Age Adjusted Rate"
- Select location:
    - States: All
- Select years and demographics:
    - Age Group:
        - under-5 downloads: "<1 year" and "1-4 years"
        - over-65 downloads: "65-74 years", "75-84 years", and "85+ years"
        - all ages: "All ages"
    - Year: each year had to be downloaded individually, so with each download we would select one year from the available 1999-2014 range
    - Gender: With the first set of downloads, only "All Genders" was chosen
- Other options:
    - Export Results: checked
    - Show Totals: checked
    - Show Zero Values: checked
    - Show Suppresed Values: checked
    
In total, the Mar 17, 2016 download consisted of 48 files (16 years X 3 age groupings).

### Output
Each file downloaded contained:
- County name
- County code
- Deaths
- Population
- Crude rate
- Age adjusted rate

The age adjusted rates were adjusted only for the age groups included in that download (e.g. "65-74 years", "75-84 years", and "85+ years" for the "over-65" download). Information on populations and methods used for age-weighting are available [here](http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#2000%20Standard%20Population) and [here](http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#Age-Adjusted%20Rates).
